PR6:

  * [jdocs](http://www.jdocs.com/) --- tends to encounter unexpected errors, at least now
  * [Google docreader](http://code.google.com/docreader) --- not for javadoc, but for pages written in a certain wiki format

PR4:

  * [Docjar](http://www.docjar.com/) --- seems to index javadocs and jars
  * [javadoc-search-frame](http://code.google.com/p/javadoc-search-frame/) --- greasemonkey script with a pretty cool interface (works with firefox and chrome only AFAICT)

PR3:

  * [Windows Help](http://www.allimant.org/javadoc/) --- javadocs converted in the windows help format

PR2:

  * [Globaldocs](http://globaldocs.info/) --- javadoc aggregator and browser

Others:

  * [Javadoc online](http://www.javadoconline.com/) --- google-like search engine for javadocs; the sourceforge project jdolplugin is an eclipse plugin that wraps it
  * [manabase](http://java.manabase.com/) --- provided the original inspiration, but is a bit slow
  * [javadoc search CGI script](https://sourceforge.net/projects/javadoc-search/) --- died 5 years ago, but has a thousand downloads
  * Eclipse knows to search for classes and show the associated javadoc
